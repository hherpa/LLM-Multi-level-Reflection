## Project Goals

- Creation of a database of reflective judgments for training
- Improving the quality and naturalness of dialogue with LLM agents
- Development of self-analysis and critical thinking abilities

## Architecture

### 1. Initial Response Generation
- The agent receives a query and forms a primary response

### 2. Critical Point Detection
- Analysis of semantic units in the response
- Assignment of confidence level to each unit
- Simulation of mPFC neural activity during information processing

### 3. Critical Point Analysis
- Generation of reflective questions
- Creation of responses in three tones:
  * logical_answer: rational thinking
  * empathic_answer: emotional intelligence
  * skeptic_answer: self-criticism

### 4. Selection
- Selection of the most relevant questions and answers
- Formation of the final set of reflections

### 5. Regeneration
- Improvement of results based on previous iterations
- Integration of different types of thinking

### 6. Validation and Storage
- Saving successful [question:answer] pairs in RAG
- Accumulation of knowledge base for improving reflection
